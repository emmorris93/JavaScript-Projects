<!-- ASSIGNMENT (Step 345)
    1. Within your React projects folder, create a new file and name it React_2.html.
    2. Open React_2.html and write out the basic HTML template. Save your file.
    3. Use the <script> tag and src attribute within your <head> element to link to the React libraries via URL:
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>
    4. Within your the <body> element, write the following code: (Step 345)
    NOTE:
        A constructor creates an object within a class
        “Props” is short for properties
        “Super” calls a constructor
        “setstate” schedules a UI update
    5. Save and run your code in the browser. Nothing is displayed! This is because we didn’t place specify a place in our HTML code to display the button. We can do that with a <div> tag and id attribute.
    6. Under the <body> tag and above the <script> element containing your React code, write the following code:
    7. Save the code and successfully run it in the browser.
