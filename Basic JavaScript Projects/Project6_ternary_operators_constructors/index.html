        <!-- ASSIGNMENT (Step 118)
                1. Within the Basic Javascripts folder, create a "Project6_ternary__operators_constructors" folder. Then, within this folder, create a new file and name it “index.html”.
                2. Within the index.html file, do the following:
                    Write out the basic HTML template.
                    Within the <head> or <body> element, write the following code:    
                        <script src="./JS/main.js"></script>    
                    Within the <body> element write all the following code:
                        <p>Riders must be at least 52 centimeters tall to ride.</p>
                        <input id="Height" value="52" />
                        <button onclick="Ride_Function()">Click here</button>
                        <p id="Ride"></p>
                    Save the file.
                3. Create a JS folder within the Project6_ternary_operators_constructors folder. Create a new file within the JS folder and name it “main.js”. In it, write the following code:
                        function Ride_Function() {
                            var Height, Can_Ride;
                            Height = document.getElementById("Height").value;
                            Can_ride = (Height < 52) ? "You are too short":"You are tall enough";
                            document.getElementById("Ride").innerHTML = Can_ride + " to ride.";
                        }
                4. Save the file.
                5. Successfully execute the index.html file in the browser. -->

        <!-- CHALLENGE (Step 119)
                Utilizing HTML, JavaScript and ternary operators, create a basic program that outputs whether or not a user is old enough to vote.
                In this program, the user will be able to input their age. If they are under 18, make it state, “You are not old enough to vote” (or a different string of your choosing). 
                If they are 18 or older, make it state, “You can vote!” (or a different string of your choosing).-->
        <p>Step 119</p>
        <p>Please enter your age:</p>
        <input id="Age" value="" placeholder="Age" />
