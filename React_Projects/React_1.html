        <!-- ASSIGNMENT (Step 343)
            1. Within your React projects folder, create a new file and name it React_1.html.
            2. Open React_1.html and write out the basic HTML template. Save your file.
            3. Use the <script> tag and src attribute within your <head> element to link to the React files that you moved into your React projects folder.
            4. Within your <body> element, write the following code: (Step 343)
            NOTE: This is all JavaScript! And remember, that’s what React is. We are calling built in React methods and functions.
            Some of the code above is React-specific, including:
                React.createClass – creates component classes
                ReactDOM.render() – used to render a React Component or Components
                React.createFactory – a function that generates a factory (object that can create other objects)
            There is also some vanilla JavaScript code we used within this, including:
                ? – a conditional operator that checks for whether or not a condition is true, the : following it is shorthand for “else”
                % – finds the remainder
                setInterval() – a method that evaluates an expression at specified intervals (milliseconds)
            Using the above React code, we created a timer that counts upward.
            5. Save and successfully run your code in the browser.

            var Counter = React.createClass({                                                       // creates component class
                render: function() {
                    var time_Passed = Math.round(this.props.time_Passed / 100);
                    var seconds_Passed = time_Passed / 10 + (time_Passed % 10 ? '' : '0.0');        // ? is a conditional operator that checks for whether or not a condition is true
                                                                                                    // the : following it is shorthand for "else" ... the % finds the remainder
                    var text = 'My React code started running ' + seconds_Passed + ' seconds ago!';
                    return React.DOM.p(null, text);
                }
            });
